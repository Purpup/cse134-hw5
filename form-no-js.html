                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <p>
                        Academics have been my gateway to the world of technology and problem-solving.
                        Currently in my final year as a Computer Science major at the University of California,
                        San Diego, I've had the privilege to delve deep into the realms of software
                        engineering and computer science. UCSD has provided me with a strong foundation in
                        algorithms, data structures, and programming languages. This journey has not only
                        honed my technical skills but also instilled in me a passion for continuous learning
                        and innovation. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I look forward to applying the knowledge I've gained at UCSD to real-world challenges
                        and contributing to the continually evolving field of software engineering.
